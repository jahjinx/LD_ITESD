    Training Notes:
        Trained On: data/target_semEval2022_en/iSarcasmEval-main/train/train.en.prepped-oversampled.csv
            This training dataset is an oversampled version of data/target_semEval2022_en/iSarcasmEval-main/train/train.En.csv
            It was obtained from SemEval2022.
            The Train/Test Split for Training & Validation is 80%, 20%
        Testing Notes:
            Tested On: data/target_semEval2022_en/iSarcasmEval-main/test/task_A_En_test.csv

✅ intermediate_XED_binary_01
    Training Notes:
        Trained On: data/inter_XED/binary/xed_binary_train.csv
            This training data is modified from the XED dataset to map negative emotions to 0 and positive emotions to 1.
            Some values are removed in cleaning, but otherwise the entire dataset is used.
    Testing Notes:
        Tested On: data/inter_XED/binary/xed_binary_test.csv
            This testing data is a subset of the training data as no dedicated testing set existed.

✅ intermediate_XED_fine_01
    Training Notes:
        Trained On: data/inter_XED/fine_grain/xed_fine-grain_train.csv
            This training data is a cleaned and train/test split subset of the XED dataset.
            Some values are removed in cleaning, but otherwise the entire dataset is used.
    Testing Notes:
        Tested On: data/inter_XED/fine_grain/xed_fine-grain_test.csv
            This testing data is a subset of the training data as no dedicated testing set existed.

✅ intermediate_SARC_01
    Training Notes:
        Trained On: data/SARC/SARC_preped_sampled_train.csv
            This training dataset originally had over 1 million samples (data/SARC/train-balanced-sarcasm.csv). 
            This would take too long to train for our purposes, so we cleaned the data and extracted 100,000 
            observations for training and 20,000 for testing.
    Testing Notes:
        Tested On: data/SARC/SARC_preped_sampled_test.csv
            The testing data is a unique subset of the cleaned training data (data/SARC/train-balanced-sarcasm.csv).
